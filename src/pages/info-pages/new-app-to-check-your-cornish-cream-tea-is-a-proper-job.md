          To celebrate Cream Tea Day on 26th June, a Cornish web developer has
          launched an app to let people check if they are enjoying their cream
          tea the proper way – the Cornish way. 


          Just upload a photo and this unique app will immediately spot if your cream tea is a proper job, with the jam and the cream the right way round! Barney Nicholls, who created the app, says: 


          *“I created this artificial intelligence using machine learning and training a neural network to recognise the difference between Cornish and Devon cream teas. Why, you ask? Well, why not! It's a bit of fun and may help people enjoy their cream tea the proper way. Hope you enjoy it - and enjoy your cream tea even more.”*
