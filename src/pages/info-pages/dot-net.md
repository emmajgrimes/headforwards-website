          All our teams are small, they range from 3-7 people max. The applications
          are all a bit different but the core theme is building responsive web
          applications using C# and JavaScript libraries like React. We are using
          .NetCore for some applications and leveraging the capabilities of Azure
          more has been a key focus for 2019.


          We are always excited about trying out new ways of delivering software. At
          the moment we are embracing TDD, pair programming and some teams are mob
          programming most of the time now. We focus a lot on releasing our software
          without manual steps. We are not quite at the point of releasing
          continuously but we do have all our regression testing running
          automatically after code commit and our applications are automatically
          (after a few human approvals) deployed into production if the tests are
          green.


          We are passionate about clean code and work hard to ensure that the code
          we create is performant, secure and easy to maintain. TDD is an approach
          that all our teams have embraced and wherever we can we try to avoid lots
          of full stack testing. We'd rather ensure that everything is working as
          part of our automated build than wait until the system is deployed. We
          have experienced software testing professionals who work within the teams
          to help us ensure that we have appropriate test coverage - no one likes
          investigating production bugs so we try to prevent as many as possible as
          early as we can. We don't have long testing phases, but we do lots of
          testing!


          Some of our developers have started organising the Cornwall .Net Developer
          meetup group and we’re looking forward to bringing people from Cornwall
          together to debate the burning issues and to learn from each other.
