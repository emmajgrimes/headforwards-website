          Headforwards was founded on the belief that clients are
          short-changed by traditional software outsource companies – mainly due
          to the ‘on-the-bench’ model of outsourcing. We believe great software
          is built by great teams. We believe in people over process and build
          all our teams based on each job’s specific needs.  \r  \r

          \r

          We believe all software deserve to be treated this way,
          irrespective of project size or roadmap.  "

          ### Proof of concept


          To prove whether a software idea can be built in the real world, what technologies should be used and whether the software is likely to be adopted by its intended users. [More details →](https://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/services/proof-of-concept/)


          ### Initial product development


          Developing and launching a new product to market requiring a rapid development cycle, strategy support, UX design and customer testing all in close client collaboration. [More details →](https://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/services/new-product-development/)


          ### Enterprise project


          A stand-alone software project to boost enterprise capabilities to support their goals. Often our clients either don't have development teams themselves or are at capacity with other work. [More details →](https://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/services/enterprise-project/)


          ### Augmented team


          A long-term dedicated team in situations where budget or other constraints don’t allow a full, cross-functional team. This model offers access to bursts of support or specialist expertise as and when appropriate. [More details →](https://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/services/augmented-team/)


          ### Dedicated teams


          Our dedicated teams can be self-contained delivery teams that provide or extend any in-house capability, or they can become an extension of existing teams, augmenting them with specific skillsets as needed.

        text: Projects are always defined by a client’s needs rather than a pre-defined
          format. Teams may be co-located or remote. They may be augmented with
          temporary developer resource or product, technical and facilitation
          consultancy. This flexibility can assist in rapid team creation and -
          in turn - rapid project starts.
