          Doing the right thing sounds straightforward, but it can be one of the
          most challenging aspects of running a business. The secret? It’s all
          about creating a culture of openness, transparency, and trust.  


          Software development is traditionally driven by two things: money and
          deadlines, but racing to meet deadlines can cause big problems with
          quality and delivery.  


          Headforwards adopts a different approach, taking the time to
          understand a client’s vision, focusing on what’s achievable, and
          prioritising the work in line with Agile principles.


          It believes this is the best way to deliver quality work, and its
          clients think so too.

      We’re in the game of setting expectations with clients, we’re completely
      open about that. We’d rather deliver clients something of value that does
      exactly what they want, than promise something unrealistic.

          Headforwards’ client relationships are based on a solid foundation of
          trust – maintained by a culture of complete transparency. 


          Through honest and frank conversations with clients the company is
          able to build stronger relationships, and work to its full potential –
          which means a better end product and happier customers.

          Whether it’s an internal team, or a relationship with a client, trust
          should dominate everything.

          Headforwards has few formal working rules. Instead it relies on
          people’s positive attitudes to work responsibly and transparently to
          get the job done. 


          What’s more, integrity is an invaluable attribute for all of its
          people – something the company prides itself in fostering.

          If we ever get things wrong, we’re the first to hold our hands up and
          say so. By doing that, it’s worth its weight in gold for the client
          relationship, not least because it’s the right thing to do anyway.
