          We’re ensuring that people are able to access high-quality services
          through digital and technology channels. It’s an ambitious programme
          and one that we’re proud to be part of. It’s a high-profile project
          and it will play a big role in delivering key initiatives in Cornwall
          over the next few years. At the heart of the project is data. There
          are over 800 different data sources coming through in various
          different formats. We’re helping to understand and organise the data
          and make it available to the people who can use it to make a
          difference.      


          You will support the initial integration of identified data sets
          ranging from internal sources systems to external data feeds into a
          cloud based relational enterprise data warehouse. Working with the
          business to identify and produce management information from this
          centralised data store using a range of data visualisation tools. The
          delivery is primarily supported by a Microsoft first approach.
          Considerations must be given to the initiation, formation and
          standardisation of best practices to support ETL procedures, data
          quality measurement, data retention, master data management and role
          management.
