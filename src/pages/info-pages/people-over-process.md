These relationships are at the heart of everything Headforwards does, and play a big part in the great service the company offers to its clients."

      It’s important to get teams working together to be the best they can be.
      This can only happen if your people gel and build their own relationships
      before building one with a client.

      - text: "Openness and honesty are the basis for all the work Headforwards does. Right from the off, both Headforwards teams and clients are included on instant messaging channels and deployment systems.\r\n\nThis creates complete transparency – so clients not only see what work is being done, they can react to it immediately with their thoughts and feedback."

      Everyone in my team is equal, and they each bring important skills and
      knowledge to the table. In my role as a Scrum Master, I work with
      influence and competency, rather than authority and seniority.

That’s why an initial workshop with the client at the start of the relationship is key. \r\n\nIt’s an opportunity for clients to establish their exact requirements, so the team at Headforwards can estimate the project’s scope, and even make a start the very same day."

      Our people are so much more than developers. Yes, they design and build,
      but they also test, deploy, and provide on-going support. It means they’re
      responsible and accountable for the full project lifecycle.
