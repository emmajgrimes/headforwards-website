      Whilst using our website, software applications or services, you may
      provide us your personal information (name, address, email, account
      details, etc.). We will use this information to administer our website,
      applications, client databases and marketing material. We will ensure that
      all personal information supplied is held securely in accordance with the

  - title: How do we collect information?
    text: >-
      Headforwards Solutions Ltd collects information in two possible ways:


      **When you directly give it to us (“Directly Provided Data”)**


      When you communicate with us, you may choose to voluntarily give us
      certain information – for example, by filling in text boxes or completing
      registration forms. All this information requires a direct action by you
      at that time in order for us to receive it.


      **When you give us permission to obtain from other accounts (“User
      Authorised Data”)**


      Depending on your settings or the privacy policies for other online
      services, you may give us permission to obtain information from your
      account with those other services. For example, this can be via social
      media or by choosing to send us your location data when accessing our
      website from your smartphone.
  - title: How long do we keep your data for?
    text: >-
      Headforwards Solutions Ltd will not retain your personal information for
      longer than necessary. We will hold onto the information you provide
      either while your account is in existence, or as needed to be able to
      provide the Services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have
      with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide
      support-related reporting and trend analysis only.


      If legally required, or if it is reasonably necessary to meet regulatory
      requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our
      Terms and Conditions, we may also retain some of your information for a
      limited period of time as required, even after you have closed your
      account or it is no longer needed to provide the Services to you.
