          When it comes to talent development, we don’t rely on traditional
          training programs. Instead, we’ve created an open, knowledge-sharing
          culture where those eager to progress can learn from some of the best
          in the business—and share their own experiences in turn.


          For the curious, dedicated and determined, this presents the perfect
          opportunity to advance their skills and discover where their ability
          can take them.

          An appetite for learning is a key characteristic of our people. If you
          are self-motivated, you’ll fit in well and you will find ample
          opportunities to learn from some fantastic people.  


          As well as our emphasis on knowledge sharing, we organise event
          visits, courses and expert-led talks to help our people stay up to
          date with the latest industry developments. Mini workshops also
          provide regular opportunities to exchange ideas, learn from each other
          and practice important skills like public speaking.

          Self-directed learning is great, but it’s also important that people
          know what opportunities are available. That’s why we developed a
          framework to help our employees identify potential career paths.
          Typical of our inclusive environment, Headforwards’ career progression
          framework was created together with the whole team, so everyone has
          input into their own development.
