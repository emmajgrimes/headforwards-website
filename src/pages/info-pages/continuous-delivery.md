          Unlike developers who work to a monthly release cycle, Headforwards
          teams are geared up to deliver new software into production every day
          – so clients get valuable new features fast.


          Almost all Headforwards’ clients benefit from continuous delivery.
          From retail organisations to financial services providers, continuous
          delivery gives clients a commercial advantage, as it means they can
          offer new services and functionality faster than their competitors.

          Switching to a continuous delivery cycle can be a big jump, but it can
          bring some huge benefits. With less time spent on testing and release
          cycles, clients can see major value early on.

          Continuous delivery is made possible by Agile practices. By breaking
          projects down into small packets of work and working on them
          iteratively, Headforwards teams can deliver against clients’
          priorities faster.


          And with weekly – or even daily – release cycles, clients can easily
          add or change requirements and barriers, such as approval stage gates,
          are removed from the process completely.

      Continuous delivery works really well with Agile development at
      Headforwards. Our teams are able to be more flexible, and it’s much easier
      working with clients on the release process.

          Teams at Headforwards are self-organising and comprised of developers
          and testers – which make them well suited for continuous delivery.


          Teams can focus on developing, testing and delivering small pieces of
          functionality each day, so the client gets fully-tested, quality
          software that meets key priorities – without having to wait for the
          next monthly release.

      When a client chooses to use continuous delivery, our teams can develop,
      test and deploy software in just a few days. Developers can focus on one
      task at a time, and results are seen much earlier on.
