          We build scalable, rich user interfaces that we are very proud of.


          We hire people who are experienced with
          JavaScript frameworks such as React/Backbone.js, but we also understand
          that some people haven’t yet used these frameworks but can bring valuable
          insight. If you are willing to learn then we’d love to hear from you.


          Our front end teams all have a solid understanding of fundamental web
          technologies - HTML, CSS, JavaScript – as you’d expect. We use Git or
          similar for version control.


          We are all on a DevOps journey. Generally we like to understand and have
          an interest in the machine that the software sits on. If you are
          interested in Continuous Delivery and bleeding the edges of your
          experience then you will fit in well here. We are working with some pretty
          exciting technologies, which we don’t expect you to have experience of
          however if you do, it would be a bonus. For exampleDocker, Kafka and
          Jenkins.


          Our people are smart, multi-cultural and real team players. Which means
          you can keep learning, taking up new challenges and really stretching
          yourself. All in a team-first environment, where there are no egos or
          political games. Just great people doing great work. So you can focus on
          what you do best –tackling real challenges head-on.

      If you are an ambitious person and want to learn, Headforwards is a good
      place to do that. You can learn off the people around you. There is a high
      skill level.
