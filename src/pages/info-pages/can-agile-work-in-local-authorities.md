    The annual Agile on the Beach conference, co-founded by one of Headforwards’
    founders, Toby Parkins is now one of the most respected agile conferences in
    the UK with a growing international audience. It’s an opportunity for Agile
    practitioners to come together to hear from some of the leading voices in
    Agile and best practice, but it’s also a great place for people to get to
    understand the principals of an Agile methodology. For our local authority,
    Agile on the Beach sparked the question, “How could we become more Agile?”

          [Cornwall Council](https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/) turned to
          Headforwards with this question. The IT team had developed a project
          called Turning the tanker, the name itself demonstrating they were
          under no illusions as to the scale of the challenge they were
          undertaking. The IT team were working on a list of 70 projects,
          running simultaneously. They were struggling to move the entire
          council workforce onto a new operating system and they were planning
          to undertake a digital transformation of all their data. The challenge
          for the leadership was significant and they were prepared to change
          approach and adopt an [Agile
          methodology](/what-we-do/create-value-through-software/) if it could
          help them move things forward.

          In local authority, public sector and even some commercial
          organisations, I’ve often seen long winded processes requiring
          mandates and multiple approval stages in order to get started. By the
          time it’s signed by all the relevant people, the budget has been
          queried, refined and resubmitted and many months could have passed.


          I always say to people to just try something. It might not solve all
          of your issues, but just have a go and see what it feels like. Agile
          is often accused of lacking rules, but actually it has a really clear
          structure. Challenging people and processes aren’t dodged but instead
          encompassed within the approach, finding the best resolution to work
          with and accommodate them, rather than worked around. 


          We were able to start working with Cornwall Council so that
          developments were delivered right away. We didn’t create an end to end
          project plan and decide exactly what the final outcome would look like
          in detail, we just started building. 


          The Council has placed significant focus on customer experience and
          our workshop approach meant the team could start looking at things
          really quickly. In 6 months we have delivered two valuable
          applications which the team are already using, quickly giving them
          something of value. Now in use we are continually adding additional
          features with the ability to test and adjust as we go.


          The other area we have focused on is Business Intelligence which is
          part of a digital transformation. There’s a huge amount of data, but
          again using our methods we’ve moved quickly and delivered value very
          quickly. I’ll get into the detail of this in another post.

          Since the Coronavirus outbreak hit, the urgent task became less about
          digital transformation and more about helping establish home working
          support and working on priorities supporting the people of Cornwall.
          Because we work to an agile methodology, we were able to change focus
          and support them in the right way when they needed it. 


          Aside from software development, our role with the council is
          supportive and consultative. They’ve been through a process of immense
          change, restructuring their IT Team and moving from a project to a
          product based approach. Within the new structure, people have new
          roles and we’ve worked closely with the core team to identify what
          products the team are really working on, rather than managing a list
          of many projects simultaneously that clearly aren’t all being moved
          forward.

          From that little seed planted at [Agile on the
          Beach](https://agileonthebeach.com/), ur local authority has gone
          through a real transformation in how they’re structured, how they
          manage products and, of course in their new Agile approach.
