Agile practitioner Toby Parkins was talking with a product owner from a global corporation, when the discussion turned to the difficulty of getting really good outsource developers.\r\n\n“He was talking about how you never get the right people, and how outsource companies just pull anyone off the bench to work on a project,” says Toby. \n\n“I knew instantly that I could put together a brilliant team for him – and the whole concept of Headforwards was founded in that moment.”"
