        text: "Proof of Concept projects are as much about learning what works as they
          are about supporting the path to further investment, whether
          internally or externally. Headforwards’ approach means we can help
          clients achieve this quickly and efficiently.  \r

          \r

          We know that speed, scope and resource need to be carefully
          managed with Proof of Concept projects. Headforwards works in close
          collaboration with the client and leverages continuous transparency
          and regular commercial check-ins, giving opportunities to change
          course if necessary. "

        quote: We believe in people and Agile principles over dogma. If we can get
          everyone to work together effectively, we’re going to get a much
          better result.

        text: "Headforwards not only offers a fast start to a project but also allows
          for flexible resourcing so that fresh skills can be added as and when
          the need arises. Working towards a proof of concept involves as many
          business and UX decisions as it does tech ones and we bring in the
          right expertise as needed to make sure our clients get the right
          result. \r

          An Agile facilitator, providing the equivalent of 1 day per
          week, can lead workshops that include customer journey maps and other
          collaborative discovery sessions.  \r

          \r

          That same facilitator will champion Agile ceremonies such as
          daily stand-ups, reviews and retrospectives that are shaed with the
          client Product Owner through a dedicated digital kanban board and
          wiki-style living documentation. "

          \r

          This client-focussed approach makes working with
          Headforwards as attractive to CTOs and CIOs in corporations and
          organisations as it is to entrepreneurs and start-ups.

          \r

          Our principles and values stay the same no matter how a
          client chooses to work with us. "
