          Headforwards is different from other software outsource companies –
          and a big part of that difference is the company’s approach to
          resourcing projects.



          At Headforwards, each client has a dedicated team, hand-picked to meet
          the client’s specific needs, and in place for the long term. To ensure
          a great cultural fit and a great start to the relationship, clients
          are involved at every step of the team recruitment process.



          Close collaboration means clients and the team get to know each other
          better every day, resulting in a strong partnership, the opportunity
          to share skills and knowledge, and a high quality of delivered
          software.

      With tightly-crafted teams for every client, everyone builds strong
      relationships with each other – it makes the challenges easier to
      overcome, and the successes even bigger.

          There can be a lot of difficult conversations during software
          development; which route to go down, which technique to use, or even
          which skills are needed on the team.


          But when there’s a strong bond between the individual team members and
          the client, finding the right solution becomes easier.

          It’s important everyone is trusted equally in our teams. The right mix
          of experiences and skills can generate some really exciting ideas and
          it completely shapes the way the project runs.
