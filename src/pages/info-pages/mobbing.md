          Imagine your entire dev team, gathered around one computer, all
          working on your project. It sounds like chaos, but it’s a brilliant
          way of delivering high quality software, fast. 


          Mob programming is used a lot at Headforwards. It’s a chance to apply a whole team’s ideas and knowledge to one project – and because they test as they go, any bugs can be instantly squashed.

    quote: Mobbing keeps everyone on the same page. Everyone agrees how the software
      will be coded, issues are picked up on fast, and we’re quicker to spot
      potential traps in the process.

          Mobbing gets even better when clients are involved, whether they’re
          visiting Headforwards in person, or videoconferencing in from their
          site. 


          The whole team comes to know each other, and everyone feels aligned and motivated to deliver a great product. It all makes for a strong working partnership – something Headforwards strives to build with every client.

          easier to collaborate and solve problems as they appear.

          Once a team tries mobbing, they often find they really enjoy working
          in such a collaborative way. Everyone at Headforwards has a specialist
          skill – whether it’s front-end development, database coding or web
          services – and mobbing means that knowledge gets shared.


          It’s a win-win: the client gets great quality software fast, and the devs and testers enjoy working together to create something of real value.

      team as people. And in the long run, it helps us grow as developers to
      produce better software, more quickly, with fewer issues.
