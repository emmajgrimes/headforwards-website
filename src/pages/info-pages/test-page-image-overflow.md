          At Headforwards, we have always had our teams located together, in
          order to make the most of team collaboration. In fact, we had been
          concerned that lack of face to face communication with working from
          home might make us less effective. This was the situation until 23rd
          March 2020 when our entire company, like many UK based businesses,
          needed to start working from home full-time.


          As we adjusted to this new world, a client asked a pertinent question: ‘Has working from home impacted our productivity?’


          Our impression was that working from home was going well. Teams had adapted to the new working practices, communication was very good, and our feeling was that we were delivering at least as much as before lockdown. After all, we were used to working remotely with our clients, so this was just an extension of that practice. But could we prove it? Could we use the data we have to measure our productivity and use that as an ongoing indicator of our performance?

          This led to much internal discussion on the best measures to use. We wanted something easy to capture and also easy to explain to anyone who looked at the reports but also indicative of the value we were delivering. We ultimately settled on simply measuring the number of user stories the teams delivered over time.


          User stories are an integral part of our agile approach. The purpose of them is to encourage the team to focus on the value of the requirement. They are expressed from the point of view of the user and explain the reason for the functionality and the benefit it will bring. Our teams are used to focusing on delivering the most valuable stories first, so we were comfortable that using the number of stories completed was a good proxy for measuring productivity.


          Since we use Azure DevOps to keep track of all the teams’ backlogs, we had a few reporting options available to us. We decided to build reports using Microsoft’s Power BI platform which had good integrations with Azure DevOps and enabled us to easily extend our reporting to pull in additional datasets and make the reports available to people who do not use Azure DevOps often.


          We created an Analytics View in Azure DevOps that retrieved a historical summary of all our teams work since the start of 2019. This let us see every change to a story’s status over time and was the basis of our historical reporting. Using Power BI measures, we calculated the average number of stories that we completed each month during 2019 and used this as a comparison with 2020 data.
