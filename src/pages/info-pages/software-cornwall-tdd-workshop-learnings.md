        text: Last week I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to attend
          Software Cornwall’s TDD workshop being run by [Jon
          Jagger](https://twitter.com/jonjagger) and [Kevlin
          Henney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevlin/). I learned a huge amount
          about testing and would be happy to do a more exhaustive write-up of
          the course if people are interested. What I’ll share here are some
          little gems of knowledge that were shared between the exercises and
          lectures that the week comprised of, often in response to difficult
          questions posed by other listeners.

        quote: Different conventions for tests and code is okay
      - type: markdown-component
        text: Whatever language you're using to solve a particular problem will have its
          own set of conventions. This could be a particular case that variables
          are written in, or a preferred way to access the elements in an array.
          Naturally, when writing our tests, these conventions tend to follow
          us. Jon and Kevlin wanted to make it clear that this needn't be the
          case. Like a letter and a shopping list might have different
          linguistic and structural conventions, so can tests and code. Your
          priority should always be clarity and communication.
      - type: quote-component
        quote: Unqualified imports [Python] are fine, the tests are the centre of the
          universe
      - type: quote-component
        quote: Tests should do more than just poke the software. They should also
          communicate thoughts & ideas
      - type: quote-component
        quote: Tests should reinterpret the requirements
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "Context: it’s okay to repeat requirements verbatim in tests, because it
          helps explain your understanding.\r


          An analogy was made to dancing, where you could lead with
          either foot (tests or code) but big strides in either are bad.\r

          One very helpful way to think about complexity they used was
          the number of calories required to understand code and tests.
          This
          could be through literally looking up and down code to find functions,
          or because there are poorly named variables that require you to
          explicitly understand what’s happening.\r\n"
      - type: quote-component
        quote: Avoid drive-by assertions in tests, a Given-When-Then [or equivalent]
          structure is preferable
      - type: quote-component
        quote: It’s hard to see problems when you’re moving fast. Slow down enough to
          look
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "Context: taken from Austin Kleon’s book Keep Going, written to help
          creative people stay creative. "
      - type: quote-component
        quote: Single-use functions are fine if they reveal intent
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "The last one might be my favourite. A justification for something that
          sometimes feels a little uncomfortable brings a great relief. \r

          The example problems on cyber-dojo.org, which are small by
          design, can highlight problems usually associated with large code
          bases in as little as thirty minutes.
          I've found the process of
          analysing these problems to be very beneficial, which is why I'm going
          to try to get into the habit of solving one problem per week to keep
          my skills sharp and continue to improve my approach to writing code
          and tests. \ 


          Probably the single most useful thing I learned was the
          concept of burning calories to understand code or tests. It's an
          abstract way to measure complexity, you could burn calories by
          literally looking up and down code to find functions, or burn calories
          by using your brain to understand some particularly complicated or
          poorly explained test.


          If any of you get the opportunity to attend a course or
          lecture given by Jon Jagger or Kevlin Henney I'd strongly suggest you
          check it out. They made an effort to tailor the course towards things
          people specifically mentioned they'd like to learn.\r


          Thanks for allowing me to attend and thanks for
          reading!\r\n"

        text: Kevlin is an independent consultant, speaker, writer and trainer. His
          development interests are in patterns, programming, practice and
          process. He has been a columnist for a number of magazines and sites
          and has been on far too many committees (it has been said that "a
          committee is a cul-de-sac down which ideas are lured and then quietly
          strangled"). He is co-author of A Pattern Language for Distributed
          Computing and On Patterns and Pattern Languages, two volumes in the
          Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series. He is also editor of 97
          Things Every Programmer Should Know. He lives in Bristol and online.
