      There’s no point creating software that doesn’t deliver value to the
      business. We work closely with our clients to ensure the software we
      produce will really help them reach their goals.

          Headforwards’ teams immerse themselves in the business they’re working
          with at the start of every project. It’s the best way to ensure they
          can understand and meet the client’s needs every step of the way. 


          Agile principles are tightly integrated to the development lifecycle,
          which means teams can develop each iteration fast, and adapt quickly
          as requirements change.

      In most cases, our clients’ requirements never stay the same throughout
      the entire project—and we embrace that. Using Agile principles, we’re able
      to ensure the software we’re delivering always has genuine value to the
      business.

      - text: "As an integral part of the client’s team, it’s easy for Headforwards to measure the value created and monitor a project’s success.\r\n\nThat’s why development is often just the start. Headforwards’ teams stay with clients after deployment to measure their impact, identifying metrics like usage, user experience and stability, and updating software when needed."
