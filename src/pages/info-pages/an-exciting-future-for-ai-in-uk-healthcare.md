        The UK government has already committed to a £250 million investment in AI
        technology, which includes the setting up of a National Artificial
        Intelligence Laboratory to help develop new solutions for the NHS. AI
        technologies will play an important role in helping the NHS to achieve more
        with its resources. 


        AI is seen as a valuable, strategic tool that can assist the skilled work of
        clinicians, rather than replace them. Crucially, it is hoped that AI will be
        able to reduce the burden on medical staff and free up more time for them to
        spend on face to face patient care. No wonder then that an estimated 52% of
        NHS trusts are already deploying AI technologies. 


        [Kelvyn Hipperson](https://www.cornwallft.nhs.uk/meet-the-board), Chief
        Information Officer, [Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Royal
        Cornwall Hospitals NHS](https://www.cornwallft.nhs.uk/the-trust) Trust, says:
        “Fundamentally, the role for AI is to help clinicians deliver more effective
        patient care. AI has been emerging for many years – but now the rate of
        adoption is accelerating. It is set to be a real game changer.”


        “AI is already making a difference across healthcare settings. For example, we
        have recently upgraded our voice recognition system and the improved
        capability means we now have better resilience in our clinical documentation
        processes. Whether in the community, GP surgeries or hospitals, AI will soon
        be helping deliver improved healthcare in the UK.”


        Here are five ways in which AI is beginning to transform the way that healthcare is delivered:

          Examining thousands of x-rays or mammograms is painstaking work and
          the signs of illnesses like cancer can be difficult to identify. So
          there is currently worldwide interest in using AI to support this
          analysis. 


          Recently, the journal Nature published the results of a trial [that
          used an AI system to analyse 29,000
          mammograms](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50857759). The software
          had been taught to identify the presence of tumours. The research
          found that the AI system was as successful in identifying cancers as
          using two trained doctors to carry out the work, which is how
          mammograms are currently reviewed. The next challenge is to see how
          this approach could be upscaled to a clinical setting. 


          AI has the potential to enhance our testing for a wide range of
          cancers and other life-threatening conditions, including
          cardiovascular disease.

          AI can provide new techniques for pro-actively analysing the wealth of
          data that we hold on patients, including the results of DNA testing.
          This could be used to identify those who are at risk of developing
          specific chronic illnesses in the future. As a result, a new approach
          to precision medicine could be developed, focused on prevention rather
          than cure. This would have huge implications for the way that the NHS
          operates.  


          The British Heart Foundation is [helping to fund the development of an
          AI tool
          ](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/research/artificial-intelligence)that
          will help doctors identify those patients that are at future risk of
          suffering a heart attack or stroke. A team of researchers led by the
          University of Cambridge will use the long-term health records of over
          two million people in the UK to develop a new machine learning
          algorithm to automatically predict peoples' risk.

          AI is opening up new ways of managing complex medical facilities,
          taking into account the vast amount of data that now needs to be
          processed in order to aid management decision making.  


          Bradford Royal Infirmary has become the [first hospital in Europe to
          launch an AI-powered command
          centre](https://www.bradfordhospitals.nhs.uk/2019/06/27/bradford-breaks-new-ground-with-head-of-clinical-artificial-intelligence/).
          Rather like an air traffic control system, it gives an instant,
          real-time overview across the 800-bed hospital and helps staff make
          quick and informed decisions on how to best manage patient care.
          Advanced algorithms help staff to anticipate and resolve bottlenecks
          in care delivery before they occur, enabling more responsive treatment
          and better allocation of resources.

          Working with AI systems gives clinicians the potential to develop
          completely new ways of diagnosing conditions, leading to earlier
          treatment and better outcomes. 


          For five years, [Moorfields Eye
          Hospital](https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/content/breakthrough-ai-technology-improve-care-patients)
          has been working in partnership with AI specialist, DeepMind.
          Together, they have successfully trained an AI system to accurately
          identify signs of eye disease and recommend how patients should be
          referred for care. The system can deliver the correct referral
          decision for over 50 eye diseases with 94% per cent accuracy, which
          Moorfields say is comparable to world-leading eye experts. This means
          that severe eye diseases can be identified and treated before there is
          irreversible damage.

          AI-driven systems are opening up new ways of providing healthcare and
          advice remotely. Not only is this more convenient for patients, but it
          can also help to significantly reduce pressure on GP surgeries and A&E
          departments. It has the further benefit of getting patients more
          pro-actively involved in the management of their health.  


          For example, [Lifelight](https://lifelight.ai/) is a software
          technology that measures blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and
          oxygen saturation in just 40 seconds simply by a patient looking into
          the camera on a standard smartphone or tablet. No wearables or contact
          is needed. Lifelight’s algorithms are trained using data from an 8,500
          patient clinical study at Portsmouth Hospitals Trust. Not only does
          Lifelight allow fast, contactless ward observations and it could also
          offer a patient at home the ability to measure their own vital signs
          with their smartphone as part of a 111 call or remote consultation.

          While AI has the power to transform many aspects of the NHS over the
          coming years, it is clear that a number of challenges will need to be
          met in order for it to achieve its full potential. These include: 


          * Scaling up from trials to full systems 

          * Proving the long-term benefits of AI systems versus costs 

          * Understanding the impact on clinical workflows 

          * Training staff to understand and use the new technology 

          * Reassuring and educating patients so that they accept the new
          approach  


          Kelvyn Hipperson adds: “Clinical safety and IT safety have to work
          together. As a technologist, one of the big challenges is managing the
          introduction and trial of new technology and balancing this with the
          need to manage long term sustainability. We need to trial innovative
          new technology – but simultaneously have one eye on what the exit
          strategy will be if a new technology does not work out and we need to
          replace it. How can we manage this, whilst not risking clinical safety
          or compromising patient care? This is a constant challenge and one
          that requires agility on the part of technologists and clinicians
          alike.”


          As technologists and healthcare providers rise to these challenges, we
          will see more and more exciting applications of AI emerging over the
          next five years.  


          As a leading software developer, Headforwards is looking forward to
          helping drive the innovation in AI that will keep UK healthcare ahead.
